# Trading Bot

## Overview

The Trading Bot is an automated tool designed to help traders efficiently monitor stocks for **Opening Range Breakouts (ORB)**. It notifies users when the price of a stock breaks the ORB range, allowing them to enter trades—either long or short—based on these breakouts. This tool eliminates the need to manually watch multiple stocks throughout the trading day, ensuring that traders don’t miss guaranteed profitable trades.
